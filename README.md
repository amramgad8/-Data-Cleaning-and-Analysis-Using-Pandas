# 🔍 Data Cleaning and Analysis Using Pandas 📊

Recently, I worked on cleaning and analyzing cricket player statistics using Python and the Pandas library. I took the data from an external source, imported it into an Excel file, and performed a thorough cleaning process to ensure everything was accurate and consistent.

Here’s a quick summary of the process:

The first dataset included information like matches, runs, and strike rates, with separate columns for the start and end years of the players' careers.

The second dataset combined the career span into one column and used abbreviations for some of the columns, but it had some duplicates and approximations (like ball-faced data marked with a ‘+’).

After cleaning, I renamed the columns to make them easier to read.

I also did some analysis to find key differences, such as formatting, abbreviations, and missing values.

Additionally, I used the Matplotlib library to create some visual charts, which helped in making the data easier to understand.

Being able to clean and analyze data, rename columns for clarity, and create visualizations is essential for data-driven decision-making. #DataScience #Python #Pandas #Matplotlib #DataCleaning #CricketStats"
